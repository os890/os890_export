!!!please report if an example doesn't work with the current milestone!!!

these examples should work with the current milestone of extval.
however, they are checked directly before a final release of a extval version.
so it might be better to have a look at the tagged examples (see: http://code.google.com/p/os890/source/browse/#svn/tags/java/web/jsf/extval/)
